JKG3 Theme
=============

This is a simple lightweight theme for the textpattern CMS. Developed for use on the jkg3.com blog. 

Setup
-------

To use this theme upload all of the file to the root of your file server. Then log into textpattern and replace your default page with:

	<txp:php> include("default.php"); </txp:php>
	
Once you have setup the page, you then need to setup the theme. Copy the contents of:

	/default_form.php
	
Into the default article form in textpattern.
	

Contributing

This is a little side project for me. Feel free to fork and improve!
